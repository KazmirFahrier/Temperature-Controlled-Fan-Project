# Temperature-Controlled Fan System Using Arduino üå°Ô∏èüåÄ

This project demonstrates an embedded system that uses a temperature sensor to automatically control the operation of a DC motor (acting as a fan) based on the ambient temperature. 
This simple and efficient system can be used for applications like automatic cooling systems, temperature-sensitive devices, or any scenario where temperature-based actuation is required.

## Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate how to interface a temperature sensor with an Arduino to control a DC motor. The fan turns on when the temperature exceeds a defined threshold and turns off when the temperature is below the threshold.
This showcases how embedded systems can be used to automate devices based on environmental inputs.

## Components and Their Purpose:

### Arduino Uno R3:

#### Purpose:

Acts as the microcontroller that processes input from the temperature sensor and controls the motor.
It reads the temperature data, compares it to the set threshold, and then switches the motor on or off based on the result.

#### Key Feature: 

Versatile and widely used for prototyping in embedded systems and IoT applications.

### TMP36 Temperature Sensor:

#### Purpose:

Measures the ambient temperature and outputs an analog voltage proportional to the temperature. The Arduino uses this voltage to calculate the temperature in degrees Celsius.

#### Key Feature: 

Outputs a voltage of 10 mV/¬∞C, allowing for precise temperature measurement.

### DC Motor:

#### Purpose:

Simulates a fan in this project. It turns on when the temperature exceeds the threshold and turns off when the temperature is below the threshold.

#### Key Feature: 

Requires external power (9V battery) for operation, as the Arduino cannot supply enough current directly.

### NPN Transistor (e.g., 2N2222):

#### Purpose: 

Acts as an electronic switch controlled by the Arduino to turn the motor on or off. 
The transistor enables the Arduino (which operates at low current) to control the higher current required by the motor.

#### Key Feature: 

The transistor allows current to flow through the motor when a signal is applied to its base from the Arduino.

### Diode (e.g., 1N4007):

#### Purpose:

Provides protection to the transistor by preventing voltage spikes (back EMF) generated by the motor when it is switched off. This ensures the longevity of the circuit components.

#### Key Feature: 

Protects against reverse currents when the motor suddenly stops, preventing damage to the circuit.

### 220Œ© Resistor:

#### Purpose: 

Limits the current flowing into the base of the transistor to protect it from excessive current. It ensures that the transistor operates safely.

#### Key Feature:

Current-limiting component that prevents damage to the transistor‚Äôs base.

### 9V Battery:

#### Purpose: 

Provides the necessary power to drive the motor. The Arduino alone cannot supply the motor with sufficient current, so the battery is used as an external power source.

#### Key Feature: 

Independent power source that ensures the motor receives adequate voltage and current for operation.

### Breadboard and Jumper Wires:

#### Purpose:

Facilitates the connection of all components in the circuit without the need for soldering. The breadboard allows for easy and flexible circuit assembly.

#### Key Feature: 

Allows for quick prototyping and testing of circuits.


## How It Works:

### Temperature Sensing: 

The TMP36 temperature sensor continuously measures the ambient temperature. The sensor‚Äôs output voltage changes linearly with temperature, and the Arduino reads this value using an analog input pin.

### Arduino Processing: 

The Arduino converts the sensor's analog output into a temperature reading in degrees Celsius. It compares the measured temperature to a predefined threshold (set in the code).

### Motor Control:

When the temperature exceeds the threshold (e.g., 30¬∞C), the Arduino sends a signal to the NPN transistor's base through a 220Œ© resistor. This switches the transistor on, allowing current to flow through the motor and power it.
When the temperature drops below the threshold, the signal to the transistor is turned off, which cuts off the current to the motor and stops it.

### Circuit Protection: 

The diode across the motor terminals ensures that any reverse voltage (back EMF) generated when the motor stops does not damage the transistor or the rest of the circuit.
